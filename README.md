# Typescript Reinforcement Learning Library

This is a RL focused library built with typescript, enabling faster bug-free development and scalability and more.

Why RL with typescript / javascript? I don't know yet.

Inspired by [Andrej Karpath's blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/), I'm building this to get a strong, end to end understanding of deep learning and reinforcement learning.
