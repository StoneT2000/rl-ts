# Typescript Reinforcement Learning Library ðŸ¤–

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rl-ts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/rl-ts)

This is a RL gym and library built with **typescript**, enabling faster bug-free development, powerful web visuals, and a gateway to developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms on the web and / or with node.js

Install with

```
npm install rl-ts
```

To get started - WIP

## Features

- Uses a **Open AI Gym** like interface to provide an accessible and general approach for developing environments and testing models

- Provides [standard integrated environments](https://github.com/StoneT2000/rl-ts/tree/main/src/RL/Environments) like CartPole

- Provides a toolbox of baseline agents such as DQN, as well as other algorithms like policy iteration.

- **typescript** means types, less bugs, and powerful, easily buildable, visuals.

Why RL with typescript / javascript (TS/JS)? TS/JS powers the web and a ton of the awesome visuals you see online.
While indeed production level reinforcement deep learning should be done with python / C++, TS/JS makes it easy to directly integrate RL
into the browser and serve not only as a simple integration for visualizers, but also as a powerful web-based teaching tool on RL. Moreover, this library can help developers with a background in TS/JS ease their way into using python / C++ for RL.

Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/), I'm building this to get a strong, end to end understanding of deep learning and reinforcement learning. While one could just use his library or some of the other ones out there, none of them are built with typescript / actively maintained, nor is there really an emphasis on structured environments and viewers that leverage TS/JS. Typescript enables typing which massively improves the scalability and maintainability of this library and enables a much more in depth TS/JS based RL library.

## Road map and plans

This library aims to be effectively a combination of the Open AI Gym and a miniature Stable Baselines, with more emphasis on naive RL algorithms to be used as a educational resource and help build more powerful and accessible environment viewers.

## Development

First install all necessary dependencies via

```
npm i
```

To build the library run

```
npm run build
```

To run tests run

```
npm run tests
```
